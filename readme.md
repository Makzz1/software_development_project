A hotel wants to develop a system to manage their take-away service. The system should maintain the menu of the day. From the customer end, the system should be able to assign tokens for the registered orders and display the bill amount. The order should be confirmed
after receiving the payment and send a notification to the customer and the hotel manager.Appending the order should be disabled after payment. From the hotel manager's end, orderwise and item-wise lists should be displayed. Orders with 3 or less than 3 items can be given
higher priority. The availability of a food item should be updated to the manager and the customer (during ordering). When the order is ready, a notification should be sent to thecustomer for collecting their order.
